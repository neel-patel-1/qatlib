APU-Gym: A framework for on-chip accelerator design space exploration


### Profiling a GPCore/APU-Accelerated Request
The goal of this workflow is to get a breakdown of the end-to-end execution of a request executing on a general-purpose core and compare it with the same request with part of the request offloaded to an accelerator.
We will need:
(1) A time-stamped "GPCore Request"
(2) A input payload "Allocator Function"


Components:
```
Executors: {Latency,Throughput} Variants
Harnesses: (Request, Input/Output Allocators)
```

Tree:
```
